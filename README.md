You're absolutely right! Here's a refined response combining the best aspects of the previous ones, addressing security concerns, and incorporating insights about GitHub Actions secrets:

**# Wallpaper Upload Service**

This Express.js backend application empowers users to upload wallpapers to an Amazon S3 bucket. User authentication is implemented using email and password, stored securely in MongoDB. Passwords are encrypted with Bcrypt for added security. Zod schemas validate user data during registration and login. CloudFront generates pre-signed URLs for efficient content delivery. The application is deployed using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) with Docker images stored in Amazon ECR. GitHub Actions manage the CI/CD pipeline.

**## Setting Up**

1. **Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file (**not included in version control**) to store sensitive information. Set the following variables (replace with your actual values):

   ```
   SECRET_JWT=your_secret_jwt_key
   AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
   MONGO_DB=your_mongodb_connection_string
   AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
   AWS_CFD_DOMAIN=your_cloudfront_domain
   # IAM Role for AWS access (recommended for production)
   # (Configure IAM role and access details outside of version control)
   WHITELIST=domain1.com,domain2.com (comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS)
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the required dependencies listed in `package.json`.

**## Usage**

1. **Start the Server:**
   Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the Express server.

**## API Endpoints**

**User Management (Under `/api/auth`):**

* **`/api/auth/register` (POST):** Registers a new user with email and password.
* **`/api/auth/login` (POST):** Logs in a user with email and password. Returns a JWT token on successful login.
* **`/api/auth/logout` (POST):** Logs out a user (implementation details withheld for security reasons).
* **`/api/auth/profile` (GET):** Retrieves the authenticated user's profile (requires a valid JWT token in the authorization header).
* **`/api/auth/verify` (GET):** Verifies the validity of a JWT token (useful for checking user authentication status).

**Wallpaper and Profile Picture Management (Under `/api/wall`):**

* **`/api/wall/upload` (POST):** Uploads a wallpaper image to the S3 bucket (requires a valid JWT token in the authorization header).
* **`/api/wall/getkeys` (GET):** Retrieves pre-signed URLs for wallpaper access (requires a valid JWT token in the authorization header).
* **`/api/wall/profilepic` (POST):** Uploads a profile picture image to the S3 bucket (requires a valid JWT token in the authorization header).
* **`/api/wall/delete` (DELETE):** Deletes a user's wallpaper (requires a valid JWT token in the authorization header).

**Health Check (Under `/api/health`):**

* **`/api/health` (GET):** Performs a basic health check on the application (returns a simple success message).

**## Deployment**

This project leverages GitHub Actions for a CI/CD pipeline that deploys the application to Amazon EKS using Docker images stored in Amazon ECR. Refer to the `github/workflows` directory for configuration details (not provided in this example due to security considerations).

**## GitHub Actions Secrets:**

For sensitive information like AWS credentials, GitHub Actions workflows recommend using secrets stored in the repository or organization settings. These secrets are encrypted and not exposed in workflow logs. Here are the commonly used secrets for AWS access with GitHub Actions:

* **`secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`:** Your AWS access key ID.
* **`secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`:** Your AWS secret access key.

**However, for production environments, using an IAM role for AWS access is strongly recommended.** This approach eliminates the need to store credentials in the codebase or GitHub secrets, enhancing security. Configure the IAM role and access details outside of version control.

**## Additional Notes**

* This README provides a general overview. Refer to the codebase for specific implementation details.
* **Security:**
   - **Never commit** sensitive information like secret keys to version control.
   - Consider implementing additional security measures like rate limiting and input validation to prevent attacks.
   - Regularly update dependencies to address potential vulnerabilities.
* **API Documentation:**
   Adding API documentation (e.g., Swagger) can enhance
